#### Step 1: Generate Synthesized Text Scene Dataset 
You can download our SynText dataset on [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10DPeYjcpqO_Pxi3KC4kGitGW0Ytc3Eo1?usp=sharing).
Alternatively, you can generate by your own. Please refer to [srnet](https://github.com/Niwhskal/SRNet). We slightly change the code from its origin. Please refer to [generate-syntext](generate-syntext/) directory.

Please go to `generate-syntext/` directory and run 
```
python datagen.py
